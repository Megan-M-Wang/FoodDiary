# Project 4 - *Food Diary*

**Food Diary** is an app that displays photos of food that the user posts

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User takes a picture, punches in the restaurant, adds it to their food diary

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Sort food posts/entries by restaurant, date, user, etc.
- [ ] Yelp/Instagram integration
- [ ] General sharing options
- [ ] Using Yelp API: insert restaurant, use yelp api to auto fill information about the type of food. so say i put in shizen, it would add tags to the post "vegan" "sushi" "japanese" etc. and the user can of course remove them. (maybe only add if user says autofill)
- [ ] Save location in case sort by location. very optional
- [ ] User gives link to an instagram post, import photo, post description, time/date, etc - and add it to food diary
- [ ] User gives instagram account, get all the photos, allow user to select all posts they want to import
